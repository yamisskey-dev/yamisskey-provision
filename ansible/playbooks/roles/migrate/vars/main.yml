# MinIO Migration Configuration
# Note: Most variables are now set dynamically in the main.yml tasks file

# MinIO Client Aliases
# 一時的なエイリアス名を使用（既存のyaminioエイリアスと競合を避ける）
source_minio_alias: "migration-source"
target_minio_alias: "migration-target"

# Advanced configuration
migration_retry_count: 3
migration_timeout: 3600  # 1 hour timeout for large migrations

# Notes for yaminio alias compatibility:
# - Both balthasar and raspberrypi can use 'yaminio' as their permanent alias
# - During migration, temporary aliases (migration-source/migration-target) are used
# - After migration, both hosts can continue using 'yaminio' independently
